# HighChartsTest

Used HihgCharts to visualize data
Used Nodejs to send the images generated by HihgCharts to a user by the time specified by the user

## Installation
npm i / npm install

## Run
node server.js

Go to http://localhost:8080

## Front end
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HighCharts

## Back end
NodeJS, Express


## Problem:
Now the server can send email to a user based on the time he chooses, but it does not send any images. Need to find a way to convert the graph generated by High Chart to pdf and then send the pdf to the user.
